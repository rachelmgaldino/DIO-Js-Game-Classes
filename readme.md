# Game Class Challenge

This is a challenge from the DIO Bootcamp Potência Tech iFood - Programação do Zero. 

## Objective 

The challenge consists of creating a generic hero class for a game. The class should include a method named attack that outputs a message indicating the type of attack based on the hero's class and the final output should demonstrate the hero's attack with the appropriate type-specific description.
